# OPTIONAL: Post-Install Tutorial

## 1 · Update Base System

```bash
# Bring everything to the latest version
sudo pacman -Syu
```

---

## 2 · Install AUR Helper (yay)

### 2.1 Prerequisites

### Set Kitty as default terminal in KDE:

* Go to System Settings
* Then to Default Applications
* locate "Terminal Emulator"
* Set it to `kitty`

### Clear Konsole Global Shortcut and set it to Kitty instead

* System Settings → Shortcuts → Global Shortcuts → search for `konsole`
* Unbind Konsole from Ctrl+Alt+T
* After you clear its shortcut, hit Apply. 

### Bind Kitty to Ctrl+Alt+T
* While still in Global Shortcuts, click “Add Application,” pick `kitty`, set the shortcut to `Ctrl+Alt+T`, then Apply.
* If a conflict dialog appears, choose to reassign.
* Test it by pressing the shortcut. `kitty` should now launch with it instead of `konsole`

### Launch Kitty

* Either open it with your shortcut, or click the application launcher located on the bottom left of the panel.
* Navigate to the "System" submenu, then locate & launch the program entitled: `kitty`

### Essential build tools, you already installed these during install but just to be sure
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git  # when you run pacman with the --needed flag it will skip
                                        # any package that is already on the system. Try it.
```

### 2.2 Build and install yay
```bash
cd /tmp                                      # go to the temporary directory
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git  # clone the yay pkgbuild from the aur
cd yay                                       # enter the cloned folder
makepkg -si                                  # build the package, then install it and deps
cd ~ && rm -rf /tmp/yay                      # go home, remove the temporary build folder

yay --version  # quick test | NOTE: Whenever you run any 'yay' command, do not use 'sudo' before it.
yay -S --needed --noconfirm fastfetch   # The --noconfirm flag makes it auto confirms the endless
                                        # questions if you want to install something or not.
```

### 2.5 Shell and terminal bliss
```bash
# Oh-my-zsh makes your terminal nicer, zsh-autosuggestions and the other are plugins
# More on them later.
yay -S --needed --noconfirm oh-my-zsh-git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

### Copy .zshrc default template config

```bash
# This makes it so you don't have to write out a buncha crap
cp /usr/share/oh-my-zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

### Configure ~/.zshrc

```bash
# Tip: You can press F12 to insert the letter ~ into the terminal
# This avoids having to spider-man hand ALT + whatever to write it
#
nano ~/.zshrc

# Add this to () in plugins:
#
(git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)

# You are also going to want to set your name in PROMPT, otherwise it will just be `~`
# The "PROMPT" below will look like this: [ArchLars], with Arch in Arch blue and Lars in white, same with brackets.
# The ~ will be in cyan, which is your working directory.
# This is a fine early profile name, you can make it nicer later.
#
# Replace "Lars" with your own name and add this to the very bottom of ~/.zshrc:
#
PROMPT='%F{white}%B[%F{#1793d1}Arch%F{white}Lars%F{white}] %F{cyan}%~ %f%(!.#.$) '

# Also optionally add any aliases here
#
# Here is one for installing packages:
# alias pacin='yay -S --needed --noconfirm'
#
# with this you can just write 'pacin' and then package to install anything
# Example: pacin firefox
# Reason why this is optional is because some might consider it risky
```

### Reload & Guide
```bash
# Then reload zshrc like so:
source ~/.zshrc

#   GUIDE:
# 
# - Right arrow: accept a suggestion to autocomplete a command you've run before. 
#
# - Up arrow: recall a previous command that starts the same way. 
#   For example, type 'sudo', then press Up, and it fills in the rest. 
#   This is useful when installing packages, like you will in this tutorial.
#   Every time you type 'yay', you can press Up to autofill your usual flags, 
#   then replace the package name with something else.
#
# - Syntax highlighting makes commands easier to read, and helps you spot obvious mistakes.
#
```

## 3 · System Optimisation

### 3.1 Pacman candy
Edit `/etc/pacman.conf`:
```ini
# Color adds color (duh), ILoveCandy is a fun optional easter egg type setting that adds animations to when you update pacman. No spoilers.
Color                      # uncomment
ILoveCandy                 # add under Color
```

### Enable syntax highlighting in nano
```bash
# create your nano config if it does not exist
mkdir -p ~/.config/nano

# package with enhanced rules
yay -S --needed --noconfirm nano-syntax-highlighting

# enable all bundled syntaxes
printf 'include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"\ninclude "/usr/share/nano/extra/*.nanorc"\n' >> ~/.config/nano/nanorc
echo 'include "/usr/share/nano-syntax-highlighting/*.nanorc"' >> ~/.config/nano/nanorc
```
### Turn off that incessant beeping in kitty without doing it system wide.
```bash
# You can turn this off system wide in KDE settings, but that is a bit overkill.
nano ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf

# Add these lines:
enable_audio_bell no
visual_bell_duration 0
window_alert_on_bell no
bell_on_tab none

# reload the config
CTRL + SHIFT + F5

# Test that the violation of the Geneva Convention is gone. Printing '\a' should send the BEL character which triggers it if not.
printf '%b' '\a'
```

### Show asterisks when typing your sudo password
Use `visudo` and add the `pwfeedback` default. This is the safe way to edit sudoers.
```bash
# open a drop-in with visudo
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/pwfeedback

# add exactly this line, then save and exit
Defaults pwfeedback

# test by forcing a fresh prompt
sudo -k
sudo true
```
### Persist configure X11 keymap for non U.S keyboards

```bash
# even if you dont use x11 it's good to set this just in case
# ignore if you dont use a weird keyboard (non US one = weird)
cat << EOF > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "system-keyboard"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XkbLayout" "no"
    Option "XkbModel" "pc105"
EndSection
EOF
```
### Install Basic packages:

```bash
# essential stuff to have.
yay -S --needed --noconfirm informant \
gst-libav gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly \
noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-extra systemd-timer-notify rebuild-detector \
python-pip kdeconnect journalctl-desktop-notification

# browser
yay -S --needed --noconfirm firefox

# or anything else
yay -S --needed --noconfirm chromium   # example of "anything else"
```

### Configuring Firefox:

#### (Optional) - Force Firefox to use Dolphin
```bash
# Optional if needed. GDK_DEBUG=portals set earlier should have done it.
# If not, force Firefox to do it, open about:config and set:
widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker → 1 (always)
```

#### (Optional) - Add all buttons to Firefox
```bash
# Sometimes Firefox does not have the minimize and maximize buttons
# You can try this remedy:
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'icon:minimize,maximize,close'

# If that still doesn't work, then try:
yay -S --needed --noconfirm xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
```

#### Make Firefox follow your KDE default apps via mimeapps.list on Arch.
```bash
# create if not already created
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications

# backup if a real file already exists
[ -f ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list ] && \
  mv ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.bak

# symlink
ln -sf ~/.config/mimeapps.list ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
```
#### Add VA-API to Firefox (GPU accelerated video)
```bash
# Confirm VA-API support
vainfo

# Open up about:config and set:
media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true
```

#### Ensure Firefox media keys dont conflict with Plasma
```bash
# open about:config and set
media.hardwaremediakeys.enabled → false
```

### 3.4 Raise vm.max_map_count (gaming)
```bash
# This is what Valve uses for the SteamDeck.
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/80-gaming.conf
vm.max_map_count = 2147483642
```

### 3.6 Install and configure cpupower
```bash
# cpupower sets cpu scheduler and is configurable
yay -S --noconfirm --needed cpupower 
```

```bash
# open in editor
sudo nano /etc/default/cpupower
```

```ini
# then set:
governor='performance'
```

```bash
# finally enable & verify
sudo systemctl enable --now cpupower.service
cpupower frequency-info
```

### 3.7 Apply all sysctl changes
```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

---

## 4 · Essential security and AUR quality of life

### 4.1 Firewall
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm firewalld python-pyqt6
sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=kdeconnect
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 4.2 Enable multilib for 32-bit support (pre-Steam)
Uncomment in `/etc/pacman.conf`:
```ini
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
Update your system to include multilib:
```bash
# Tip/Fun Fact: You can update your system by just writing 'yay'.
# This is actually ideal, as pacman -Syu does not update your AUR packages.
# Try it:
#

yay

# This is a good time to teach you the habit of running `checkrebuild` after updates.
# 'checkrebuild' checks if you need to rebuild any packages towards new dependencies.
#
# If you don't do that when needed, it can lead to instability.
#

checkrebuild

# usually it doesn't list anything, that means you're good, but if it does you need to run
# yay  -S <pkg> --rebuild
#
```

### 4.2.5 Steam
```bash
# then after enabling multilib DL Steam
yay -S --needed --noconfirm steam

# Run Steam in terminal to install it:
steam
```

---

## 5 · Maintenance hooks
```bash
# these hooks are great for system maintenance
#
# pacdiff shows you if any .pacnew is on your system needed to merge
# reflector will run reflector any time mirrorlist updates
# paccache-hook is the GOAT. it cleans your cache after using pacman.
# systemd-boot-pacman-hook needed to update systemd boot for you if you don't got the timer
#
yay -S --needed --noconfirm \
  pacdiff-pacman-hook-git \
  reflector-pacman-hook-git \
  paccache-hook \
  systemd-boot-pacman-hook
```

### Install & Enable Nohang:
```bash
# This is an OOM killer. It's VITAL.
yay -S --needed --noconfirm nohang-git 

# If your system fills up it's swap and RAM then this will terminate offending processes before your system freeze up.
sudo systemctl enable --now nohang-desktop.service
```

### Set Journalctl limit:
```bash
# SUPER important, journal on desktop use fills up very quickly which takes space
# a large one can slow down boot times after a while.
/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/00-journal-size.conf
```
```ini
[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=50M
```

### USB autosuspend
The Linux kernel automatically suspend USB devices when they are not in use. 
This can sometimes save quite a bit of power, however some USB devices are not compatible with USB power saving and start to misbehave (common for USB mice/keyboards). 
udev rules based on whitelist or blacklist filtering can help to mitigate the problem. ATTR{power/control}="on" disables runtime autosuspend for the matched devices; "auto" enables it for all others.  

#### 1) The example is enabling autosuspend for all USB devices except for keyboards and mice: 
```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb_power_save.rules
```
```bash
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{product}!="*Mouse", ATTR{product}!="*Keyboard", TEST=="power/control", ATTR{power/control}="auto"
```

#### 2) For USB HID “boot” keyboards and mice:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb_power_save.rules
```
```bash
# Default: enable autosuspend on USB devices
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", TEST=="power/control", ATTR{power/control}="auto"

# Keep HID boot keyboard (030101) and mouse (030102) awake
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_USB_INTERFACES}=="*:030101:*", ATTR{power/control}="on"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_USB_INTERFACES}=="*:030102:*", ATTR{power/control}="on"
```

Apply and retrigger, then recheck:
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --action=add
grep -H . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/{control,runtime_status}
```


## Video Playback

My advice is pick one here, you can do both but it's best to not clutter your system.

### Option 1) VLC

#### VLC Install:
```bash
# VLC is the only officially supported third-party player with official Phonon support on KDE.
# It's more fully featured than MPV, MPV requires more manual config to look better.
#
# install vlc (video)
yay -S --needed --noconfirm vlc vlc-plugin-ffmpeg vlc-plugins-all

# Hardware Acceleration:
## VLC automatically tries to use an available API
## You can override it by going to Tools > Preferences > Input & Codecs.
## Choose the suitable option under Hardware-accelerated decoding,

# Phonon backend (for integration within KDE):
yay -S --needed phonon-qt6-vlc

# OPTIONAL: Plugin to allow you to click on the video inside VLC's window
# and it will be paused or resumed. This is a commonly expected behavior:
yay -S --needed vlc-pause-click-plugin
```

### Option 2) MPV
#### MPV Install:
```bash
# Has become more popular in recent years, is very powerful but a bit nerdy
# If you care about manual configs and stuff use MPV, otherwise use VLC
#
# install mpv (video)
yay -S --needed --noconfirm mpv  

# (Third-party) Phonon Support for mpv
yay -S --needed --noconfirm phonon-qt6-mpv

# You have to do this if you want GPU acceleration for your wholesome entertainment
mkdir -p ~/.config/mpv
echo "hwdec=auto" > ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf
```

### ProtonUp-Qt:
```bash
# install protonup qt (ProtonGE)
yay -S --needed --noconfirm protonup-qt
```

### Configure Proton GE as the default in Steam after installing Proton GE from ProtonUp-Qt:

0. Open up ProtonUp-Qt and install the latest version of Proton GE
1. Launch Steam and open **Settings → Compatibility**.  
2. In the dropdown, choose **Proton GE**.  
3. Click OK and restart Steam.

ProtonGE is a good default for a lot of games, works just as well as regular Proton for most games and for other games include 
propietary codecs and such that Valve cannot package themselves, this helps with video files and music with odd formats.


## Final Reboot

#### Reboot again into new system and you can finally sit back, relax, and use arch btw

```bash
# reboot
reboot

# after reboot open kitty (CTRL + ALT + T)
fastfetch

# press prt scr to take a desktop photo
# save it
```

# EXTRA TUTORIAL: How to add a new Drive/SSD to GPT-Auto Setups


- Name of drive will be `data`, 
- Replace ALL instances of `data` in this guide if you don't want that name for your drive.
- And by all I mean ALL instances, even in the .mount & .automount files

#### 0) Identify the new disk (double check before you write to it)
```bash
lsblk -e7 -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL,SERIAL
DEV=/dev/nvme1n1    # <-- set this to your new disk
```
#### 1) Create a GPT partition and give it a PARTLABEL
```bash
#    WARNING: the zap step is destructive. Save data on disk first.
sudo sgdisk --zap-all "$DEV"
sudo sgdisk -n1:0:0 -t1:8300 -c1:"data" "$DEV"   # one Linux partition named "data"
```
#### 2) Make a filesystem (example: ext4)
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L data "${DEV}p1"   # remove p like in install if ur disk is 'sda' and not nvme
```
#### 3) Verify the persistent symlink created by udev, then wait if needed
```bash
ls -l /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ | grep ' data$' || true
sudo udevadm settle
```
#### 4) Create the mount point
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
```
#### 5) Create a native systemd mount unit
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount

# add
[Unit]
Description=Data SSD via PARTLABEL

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/data
Where=/mnt/data
Type=ext4
Options=noatime

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
#### Create an automount for on-demand mounting
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount

# add
[Unit]
Description=Auto-mount /mnt/data

[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
#### 6) Enable it
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now mnt-data.automount
```
#### 7) Test
```bash
systemctl status mnt-data.automount
df -h /mnt/data
touch /mnt/data/it-works
```

# NVIDIA GSP ISSUES - TUTORIAL (2025)

As of now there is an issue on Wayland with NVIDIA where the power state goes down too low on idle which causes lag and a jump during various use like desktop animations etc. The only solution for this is to either turn off GSP which you need the propietary driver to do (i.e not open kernel modules) or set minimum and max clocks so it doesn't enter that idle state. This is how to do the latter with a systemd service I wrote for it. There are trade offs to this obv, but I have done it as safe as possible by locking the VRAM clocks to a valid safe range chosen from the device’s supported table.

### 0) confirm driver + tool exist
```bash
nvidia-smi || { echo "nvidia-smi not found or driver not loaded"; exit 1; }

# try idling a bit in firefox wait 5 seconds then scroll
# you will see a noticable jump or lag when doing so, esp on 4k.

# try it again and this time run this in another monitor on a terminal:
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=clocks.mem,clocks.gr,pstate,power.draw,temperature.gpu \
  --format=csv -l 1

# you will see the jump happens from when the clocks readjust from a very low point
```

### 1) create the clock-locking script
```bash
# to solve this we will set minimum clock speed
# what it does: installs /usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh with a safe, dynamic min/max picker
sudo nano /usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh
```

```bash
# ----- /usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh -----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

GPU=${GPU:-0}
PCT=${PCT:-0.70}   # 0..1 percentile anchor
# piecewise β parameters (MHz breakpoints and targets)
B1=${B1:-5000};  B2=${B2:-10000}; B3=${B3:-15000}
V1=${V1:-0.60};  V2=${V2:-0.75};  V3=${V3:-0.80}

SUDO=""; (( EUID != 0 )) && SUDO="sudo"

# Supported memory clocks (MHz), ascending unique
mapfile -t S < <(nvidia-smi -i "$GPU" \
  --query-supported-clocks=memory --format=csv,noheader,nounits \
  | tr -d ' ' | sort -nu)
((${#S[@]})) || { echo "no supported clocks for GPU $GPU"; exit 1; }

MAX="${S[-1]}"

beta() { # β(MAX) piecewise-linear
  local m="$1"
  if   (( m <= B1 )); then
    awk -v v="$V1" 'BEGIN{print v}'
  elif (( m <= B2 )); then
    awk -v v1="$V1" -v v2="$V2" -v m="$m" -v b1="$B1" -v b2="$B2" \
      'BEGIN{print v1 + (v2-v1)*(m-b1)/(b2-b1)}'
  elif (( m <= B3 )); then
    awk -v v2="$V2" -v v3="$V3" -v m="$m" -v b2="$B2" -v b3="$B3" \
      'BEGIN{print v2 + (v3-v2)*(m-b2)/(b3-b2)}'
  else
    awk -v v="$V3" 'BEGIN{print v}'
  fi
}

# snap helper: largest supported ≤ target
pick_le() { awk -v t="$1" '$1<=t{m=$1} END{if(m)print m}'; }

# 1) Percentile anchor within supported set
k=${#S[@]}
q=$(awk -v p="$PCT" -v k="$k" 'BEGIN{printf("%d",(p*k==int(p*k)?p*k:(int(p*k)+1)))}')
(( q<1 )) && q=1
(( q>k )) && q=k
S_Q="${S[$((q-1))]}"

# 2) Fractional floor from β(MAX)
BETA=$(beta "$MAX")
TGT=$(awk -v b="$BETA" -v m="$MAX" 'BEGIN{printf("%.0f", b*m)}')
S_F="$(printf "%s\n" "${S[@]}" | pick_le "$TGT")"
[[ -n "$S_F" ]] || S_F="${S[0]}"

# 3) Final MIN = max(percentile anchor, fractional floor)
MIN="$S_Q"; (( S_F > MIN )) && MIN="$S_F"; (( MIN > MAX )) && MIN="$MAX"

echo "GPU=$GPU k=${#S[@]} MIN=$MIN MAX=$MAX (percentile=${PCT}, beta=${BETA})"

# Lock memory clocks and enable persistence
if ! $SUDO nvidia-smi -i "$GPU" --lock-memory-clocks="$MIN","$MAX"; then
  $SUDO nvidia-smi -i "$GPU" --lock-memory-clocks-deferred="$MIN" || true
fi
$SUDO nvidia-smi -i "$GPU" -pm 1
```

### 2) make it executable
```bash
# what it does: sets correct mode so systemd can run it
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh
```

### 3) create env overrides
```bash
# what it does: lets you change GPU/PCT/B1..B3/V1..V3 without editing the script
sudo nano /etc/default/nvidia-lock
```

```bash
# ----- /etc/default/nvidia-lock -----
# GPU index and percentile
GPU=0
PCT=0.70
# MHz breakpoints
B1=5000
B2=10000
B3=15000
# β targets
V1=0.60
V2=0.75
V3=0.80
```

### 4) create a systemd unit
```bash
# what it does: runs the lock at boot and keeps state via persistence
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nvidia-lock.service
```
```bash
# ----- /etc/systemd/system/nvidia-lock.service -----
[Unit]
Description=Lock NVIDIA memory clocks and enable persistence
Wants=nvidia-persistenced.service
After=multi-user.target nvidia-persistenced.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/nvidia-lock
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 5) enable NVIDIA persistence daemon
```bash
# what it does: keeps GPU initialized so your lock survives idle periods
sudo systemctl enable --now nvidia-persistenced.service
```
### 6) reload units and enable our service
```bash
# what it does: starts clock lock at boot and immediately
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nvidia-lock.service
```
### 7) verify supported clocks + current locks
```bash
# what it does: shows supported memory clocks and the lock status
nvidia-smi -i "${GPU:-0}" -q -d SUPPORTED_CLOCKS | head -n 60
nvidia-smi -i "${GPU:-0}" -q -d CLOCK | head -n 80
```
### 8) test run manually (optional)
```bash
# what it does: prints chosen MIN/MAX and applies lock interactively
sudo /usr/local/sbin/lock-nvidia-mem.sh

# now test again with the script from step 0 and see the difference
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=clocks.mem,clocks.gr,pstate,power.draw,temperature.gpu \
  --format=csv -l 1

# this also allows you to keep an eye on temps and power.
```
