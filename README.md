# Complete Arch Linux Tutorial (KDE Plasma + Wayland w/ Automounting Partitions)

This is a quick Arch installation guide for noobs that just want a working system to game on that's straight forward with a DE that is most like Windows
and usually the one most people want to use because of that, at least for their first DE. I've used every DE and WM that is both trendy and some obscure,
I started with KDE Plasma and Arch Linux. I always come back to both eventually. It's fun to try out new things, but KDE Plasma is OP at the moment I am writing 
this. It's fully featured, they finally have a good process in eliminating bugs which plagued the DE before, and it's very easy to customize. Most DEs and WMs have
some caveat, KDE Plasma does not. That is why I use it.


## NOTE (ACTUALLY READ THIS): 

So, I like to use something called `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`. I acknowledge that this is a super opinionated decision for a noob tutorial, and I debated whether or not to use it in this tutorial, but I feel it's so cromulent and underrated that I decided to make a big decision to teach you how to use it as well. If you follow this guide correctly and use it you'll see why it's very convenient.
It is not usually done on Linux and it is kind of new(?), at least relative to `fstab`, however it is a modern way of mounting partitions that are also used by other operating systems you may already be familiar with.

## What I will mainly be using/setting:

- systemd-automount for GPT partitions 
- KDE Plasma on Wayland
- NVME SSD
- `linux-zen` default kernel which is a kernel optimized for desktop use.
- `linux-lts` for a fallback and debug kernel
- zsh default shell
- systemd-boot with UKIs
- zswap with a 16 GiB swap file
- EXT4 for `/`
- AMD CPU + NVIDIA GPU w/ `nvidia-open-dkms` 
**NOTE:** This tutorial assumes you have a Turing (NV160/TUXXX) and newer	card for current driver. Check your card first.

I included some stuff for AMDGPUs too, but my system is NVIDIA so I may have missed some things.

## Prerequisites

- A bootable Arch Linux USB (written with `dd` or similar)
- Internet connection
- UEFI system
